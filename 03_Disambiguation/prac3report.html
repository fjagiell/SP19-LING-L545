<h1> L-545 Practical 3 Report of Trey Jagiella </h1>

<h2> Tagger Comparison </h2> 

<p> The two taggers I compared were UDPipe and a simple perceptron-based tagger. 

UDPipe can be found <a 

href="https://github.com/ufal/udpipe">here</a>.

UDPipe is a trainable pipeline for tokenizing, tagging, lemmatizing and parsing Universal Treebanks and other CoNLL-U files.

The perceptron-based tagger can be found <a
href="https://github.com/ftyers/conllu-perceptron-tagger">here</a> . It is designed to work with CoNLL-U files and is meant to serve as a teaching aid. </p>

<h3>Perceptron Accuracy:</h3> 
<pre>
Metrics    | Precision |    Recall |  F1 Score | AligndAcc 

-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------- 

UPOS       |     90.28 |     90.28 |     90.28 |     90.28 
</pre>
<h3> UDPipe Accuracy: </h3> 
<pre>
Metrics    | Precision |    Recall |  F1 Score | AligndAcc 

-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------- 

UPOS       |     94.64 |     94.64 |     94.64 |     94.64 
</pre>
The UPOS was more accurate for the UDPipe than for the Perceptron-based tagger by over four percent.

Unfortunately, nothing I tried increased the accuracy of the tagger.

The things I changed however, did each have a relatively minimal effect.

The changes I made were in ‘i suffix’, ‘i-1 suffix’, and ‘i+1 suffix’. Additionally, I changed word[-3:] to word[-4:] and in 'i-1 tag+i word', I changed context[i] to context[i-1].
I did try going further, replacing the -3 in word[-3:] with a positive number, commenting out certain features, and replacing the other indices which were unchanged in my final version.
However, these changes either has a much larger negative effect on the accuracy or simply did work and returned an index error.
