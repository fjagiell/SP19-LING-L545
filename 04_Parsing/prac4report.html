<p>In the first sentence, “cela signifie que leur consommation énergétique, qui représente actuellement 10% de la consommation énergétique moyenne de l'UE, enregistrera une forte augmentation à mesure qu'ils exigeront des commodités élémentaires comme l'eau chaude et, peut-être même, l'air conditionné, des moyens de transport et la modernisation de leurs industries.”, 
the same mistake was made twice for the tokens “moyens” and “modernisation”. Both are originally stated as depending on 36 “eau” but the UDPipe had them depending on 2 “signifie”, the root of the sentence.
This could not be the case since “moyens” and “modernisation” are found in a subordinate clause.</p> 

<p>In the second sentence, “Nous avons noté que la production d'électricité correspond à 30% des émissions de CO2 imputables à l'homme.”,
The word homme depends on 18, “imputables” but UDPipe marked it as depending on 15, “émissions.”
Additionally, the relationship was incorrectly marked as nmod when it is an obl:arg. </p> 

<p>Of the ten trees inspected, six of them had errors and there was a total of 19 tokens with errors among the 312 found in the ten trees.
Of the 19, all but two were assigned to depend on the wrong word.
Frequently, this word was a verb serving as the root of the sentence which the token did not directly depend on.
This can be seen in the first sentence, where both incorrect tokens were assigned to rely on the root of the sentence despite being nouns found in subordinate clauses. </p>

<p>12 of the 19 were assigned the incorrect relation with the word it was assigned to depend on.
Two of these were assigned the correct word and only had an incorrect relation.
A common mistake in assigning the role was that the original test file used the relationship fixed and the UDPipe assigned the role to be a determiner.
Additionally, it had trouble assigning oblique roles, often mistaking them for nmod.
The role of case was also mistakenly assigned several times. </p>
